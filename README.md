**ðŸ“œ Page Overview:**
The page features a **vintage cafÃ© menu background** with a semi-transparent overlay to make the food items stand out. Each menu item is represented by an image card that has two main interactive features:

1. **Hover Effect:**

   * When you hover over a food image, the **name**, **price**, and **star rating** appear as an overlay on the image.
   * This gives a quick preview without needing to click.

2. **Click-to-View Pop-up:**

   * When you click a food image, a **popup modal** opens with more details, such as:

     * Dish name
     * Cost
     * Main ingredients
     * A star rating display
     * A close button
   * This allows users to get the **full menu description** in an elegant way without leaving the page.

**ðŸ“± Mobile-Friendly Design:**

* The layout is **responsive** â€” image cards shrink and rearrange in smaller columns on mobile devices.
* The hover effects turn into **tap effects** for touchscreens.
